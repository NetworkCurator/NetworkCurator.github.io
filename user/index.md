# User's guide

NetworkCurator works along the lines of a [Wordpress blog](https://wordpress.org/). One person installs the software on a web server. Many other people can then view the resulting website.

The NetworkCurator couples a blog-like content management system with graph visualization tools. The site can manage a community of users who create, annotate, and curate network data collaboratively.

The user's guide is aimed at two types of users: site administrators and site visitors.



## Site administrators

Site administrators are those users who install and configure the software on their web server. The documentation covers

 - [Installation](install.html), and
 - [Administration](admin.html).


## Site visitors and users

Visitors to a NetworkCurator site who are not administrators interact with the hosted data through the [web interface](interface.html). 

 - Guests, i.e. users who are not logged in, can preview networks that are marked as public.
 - Registered users interact with data in a manner managed through user [permissions](permissions.html).
