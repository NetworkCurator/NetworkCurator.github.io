# Software for network analysis 

Networks are universal and generic data structures that are applied in all areas of research. There are several great applications for network data and there are several powerful tools for working with them.

Many tools focus on visualization of existinting network connections or on statistical analyses. Most run as desktop applications. 

In comparison, the NetworkCurator runs on the web and thus enables collaborative exploration and annotation. It also couples a content management system to each graph node and link, creating opportunities for communities to discuss and to curate these individual components.
