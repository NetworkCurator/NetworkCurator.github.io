# Developer's guide

The NetworkCurator is open-source software that you are free to use and modify. This chapter describes the organization of the project from a developer's point of view. 

- [File structure](server.html). This section outlines the directories and important files in the github repository. 

- [API](api.html). This section outlines application programming interface that powers user interactions with the database.

- [Database structure](database.html). This section outlines the tables of the MySQL database that is created during installation and stores user-generated data throughout the lifetime of the web application.

- [User interface](themes.html). This section outlines decoupling between the core functionality of the network curation application and the web-based user interface. This decoupling enables advanced users to create websites that use the core networkcurator infrastructure but display the content with a customized look-and-feel.
