# User Interface

NetworkCurator is a generic tool that can be used as a stand-alone website or that
can be integrated as a component of a larger service. In both cases, it may be 
desirable to adjust the look-and-feel of the user interface on a local installation
server. To facilitate such adjustments, code for the user interface is maintained up in 
a [repository](https://github.com/NetworkCurator/NetworkCurator) that is separate from all other components. This section outlines 
the structure of the user-interface code and how that structure fits with the core
code.
